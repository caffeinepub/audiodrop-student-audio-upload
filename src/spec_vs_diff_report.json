  "summary": "The diff implements in-browser recording MP3 conversion on “Use This Recording” via FFmpeg.wasm and attaches the converted MP3 file with the required filename/mimeType. The FFmpeg helper appears updated to enforce 128kbps CBR and return an audio/mpeg Blob. Submission flow changes for ensuring MP3 bytes are used rely on the attached File being the MP3; the submit-path code is truncated, so full verification is limited.",
